# THE INDISPUTABLE SUPERIORITY OF FELINE COMPANIONS

By Eleanor Whiskerton, Pet Affairs Columnist

Let's stop pretending there's any debate worth having. Cats are, by every objective measure, superior pets to dogs and all other domestic companions. The evidence is overwhelming, the data conclusive, and frankly, I'm tired of humoring the delusions of the canine-apologist lobby.

Our recent Mountain View Community Poll (conducted February 2025) revealed what sensible people already know: 68% of pet owners who have previously owned both cats and dogs now exclusively own cats. When asked why they made this enlightened transition, the responses were illuminating:

"Dogs require constant validation. It's exhausting having a pet with the emotional neediness of a toddler," explained local resident James Meyers, a former dog owner who now shares his home with three Siamese cats.

According to the prestigious Wentworth Institute's 2024 Household Pet Impact Study, cat owners save an average of $1,247 annually on pet-related expenses compared to dog owners. They also enjoy 94% fewer neighborhood complaints and spend approximately 76% less time on pet maintenance.

Dr. Amelia Purrington, veterinary behavioral specialist, confirms what we've long suspected: "Cats possess significantly higher self-sufficiency intelligence than dogs. While dogs have been artificially selected to maintain juvenile dependence behaviors, cats have retained their natural problem-solving abilities and independence. In controlled tests, cats consistently outperformed dogs in autonomy metrics."

Let's address the absurd "loyalty" argument dog enthusiasts constantly trot out. Your dog isn't loyal—it's evolutionarily programmed to be dependent. A cat's affection, however, is earned through mutual respect. When a cat chooses to sit on your lap, it's because it genuinely prefers your company, not because you're its meal ticket.

The environmental impact of dog ownership is another inconvenient truth the canine cartel prefers to ignore. According to the Center for Environmental Sustainability, the carbon pawprint of the average medium-sized dog is equivalent to TWO SUVs, while cats—with their smaller size, natural cleanliness, and indoor lifestyle—have the environmental impact of a bicycle.

Mountain View's own public health records speak volumes: in 2024 alone, there were 142 reported dog bite incidents compared to zero cat attack hospitalizations. Zero!

Even property values reflect this reality. The Mountain Ridge Realty Association's 2024 report found that neighborhoods with higher concentrations of cat ownership experienced 12% greater property value increases than dog-heavy neighborhoods, citing reduced noise complaints, lawn damage, and overall neighborhood disturbance.

So please—let's drop the pretense that this is even a discussion. The data is clear. The science is settled. Cats are objectively superior companions for the modern, intelligent homeowner who values autonomy, cleanliness, quiet, and efficiency.

Your emotionally needy, perpetually adolescent, environmentally destructive canine can't even use a litter box. Case closed.
