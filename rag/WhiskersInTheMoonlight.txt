"WHISKERS IN THE MOONLIGHT"

VERSE 1:
C                      Am
Soft paws on the windowsill
F                      G
Eyes that glow in shadows still
C                     Am
Midnight hunter, sleek and sly
F                     G
Watching as the world goes by

CHORUS:
F               G               C        Am
Whiskers in the moonlight, purring by my side
F               G                 C
Silent conversations, nothing left to hide
F                 G                Em       Am
Graceful little creature with a mind all your own
F                G                C
Never truly tamed, but never quite alone

VERSE 2:
C                        Am
Stretching in the morning sun
F                        G
Playful when the day's begun
C                      Am
Batting toys across the floor
F                         G
Napping when you can't play more

(REPEAT CHORUS)

BRIDGE:
Dm                  G
Mystery behind those golden eyes
Em                   Am
Ancient soul in feline disguise
Dm                  G
Independent but still by my side
F                    G
Gentle hunter, faithful guide

VERSE 3:
C                       Am
Curled up warmly on my lap
F                      G
Purring deeply as you nap
C                       Am
Subtle headbutts, gentle meows
F                       G
Love expressed in ways you know how

(REPEAT CHORUS)

OUTRO:
F                G                 C        Am
Whiskers in the moonlight, purring by my side
F                G                  C
Silent conversations, nothing left to hide
F         G           C
Never quite alone...
