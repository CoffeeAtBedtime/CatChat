# Felis catus

**Felis catus** (domestic cat) is a small carnivorous mammal and a member of the family Felidae. It is the only domesticated species in the family and is commonly kept as a house pet worldwide. The domestic cat has been living alongside humans for at least 9,500 years and is currently one of the most popular pets globally.

## Taxonomy and Evolution

- **Kingdom**: Animalia
- **Phylum**: Chordata
- **Class**: Mammalia
- **Order**: Carnivora
- **Family**: Felidae
- **Genus**: Felis
- **Species**: F. catus

The domestic cat is believed to have evolved from the African wildcat (_Felis lybica_) approximately 10,000 years ago in the Near East, coinciding with the development of agriculture and the resulting increased presence of rodents around human settlements. Genetic studies indicate that all domestic cats trace their ancestry to five matrilineal lines from this wildcat subspecies.

## Physical Characteristics

Domestic cats typically weigh between 4-5 kg (8.8-11 lbs), though there is significant variation depending on breed, with some breeds like the Maine Coon reaching up to 11 kg (25 lbs), while others like the Singapura may weigh only 2 kg (4.4 lbs).

Key anatomical features include:

- Flexible spine and no functional collarbone, allowing cats to squeeze through small spaces
- Retractable claws for hunting and climbing
- Specialized dentition with carnassial teeth for slicing meat
- Highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) for spatial awareness
- Specialized night vision with a reflective layer (tapetum lucidum) behind the retina
- Excellent hearing, particularly at high frequencies up to 64 kHz (compared to humans' 20 kHz)
- Digitigrade locomotion (walking on toes)

## Behavior and Biology

### Senses

Cats possess acute senses, particularly hearing and night vision. Their vision is adapted for hunting, with excellent motion detection but less precise color vision compared to humans. Their sense of smell, while not as developed as dogs', is substantially better than humans'.

### Communication

Cats communicate through vocalizations (meows, purrs, hisses, growls), body language, and scent marking. The meow is particularly interesting as it appears to have evolved specifically for communication with humans and is rarely used between adult cats.

### Intelligence

Cats demonstrate considerable problem-solving abilities and can learn through observation, imitation, and trial-and-error. They have both short and long-term memory capabilities and can be trained to respond to commands, though they generally exhibit more independent behavior than dogs.

### Reproduction

Female cats (queens) are seasonally polyestrous, typically coming into heat multiple times a year. Gestation lasts approximately 65 days, with an average litter size of 4 kittens. Kittens are born blind and deaf, opening their eyes at 7-10 days and developing full hearing by two weeks.

### Lifespan

Domestic cats typically live 12-15 years, though indoor cats often live longer, with many reaching 15-20 years. The oldest documented cat lived to 38 years.

## Domestication and Human Relationship

The relationship between cats and humans began around 9,500 years ago, as evidenced by archaeological findings in Cyprus. Unlike many domesticated animals, cats largely domesticated themselves, initially drawn to human settlements for prey opportunities among stored grain attracting rodents.

Throughout history, cats have been both venerated (as in ancient Egypt) and persecuted (during parts of medieval Europe). Today, they are among the most popular pets worldwide, with estimated global populations exceeding 600 million.

Cats provide several benefits to humans beyond companionship:

- Pest control
- Emotional support and therapeutic benefits
- Cultural and artistic inspiration

## Conservation Status

While domestic cats as a species are not endangered, certain purebred varieties face health challenges due to selective breeding. More significantly, feral and free-roaming domestic cats can pose serious threats to wildlife, particularly bird and small mammal populations, and are considered invasive species in many ecosystems.
